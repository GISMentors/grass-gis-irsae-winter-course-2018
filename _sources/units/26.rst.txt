Unit 26 - Spatio-temporal LST script
====================================

This unit is based on :doc:`20` and LST computation. The goal is to
design a simple Python script for computing LST statistics in Norway
area for given period. Input parameters:

* :param:`input` - Name of the input space time raster dataset (line :lcode:`6`)
* :param:`start` - Start date (line :lcode:`9`)
* :param:`end` - End date (line :lcode:`15`)
* :param:`output` - Name for output raster map with statistics (line :lcode:`20`)

A script outputs minimum, maximum and mean LST value. The raster map
for computing statistics is created by :grasscmd:`t.rast.series` (line
:lcode:`47`) from input space time raster dataset. Statistics is
computed by :grasscmd:`r.univar` (line :lcode:`57`). Module output is
formatted on lines :lcode:`63-65`.

In :doc:`20` space time dataset was created from data in 2017. It is
reasonable also to check input dates range, see line :lcode:`34`.

Before running the script switch to mapset created :doc:`20` -
*modis*. Procedure of changing current mapset is described in
:ref:`Workflow organization <work-organization-section>`.

.. tip::

   To decrease GRASS modules verbosity a :param:`quiet` flag can be
   set globally for the whole script by :envvar:`GRASS_VERBOSE`
   environment variable, see line :lcode:`44`. See :grasscmd:`GRASS
   GIS documentation <variables>` for other useful GRASS enviromental
   variables.

Example of usage:

   modis-date-stats.py input=modis_c start=2017-03-01 end=2017-04-01 output=stats_sep

   Min: -21.6
   Max: 5.4
   Mean: -9.4
